# Lighting-Mesh-CollisionTestbed

Quick edit: This project is on pause as it requires a levl of linear algebra I just don't have. I'll come back to this in a bit. 

This is my second adventure into the world of openGL. I realized I was spending too much time implementing minecraft features and not enough time figuring out lighting/mesh loading. This project will be focused on those two, and I might even get into collisions if I can figure it out/have time between classes.

Most of this will be me following the LearnOpenGL.com tutorial on model loading using assimp, then probably the lighting one. Once I have my feet under me I'll start trying weird things.
