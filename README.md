# Lighting-Mesh-CollisionTestbed

This is my second adventure into the world of openGL. I realized I was spending too much time implementing minecraft features and not enough time figuring out lighting/mesh loading. This project will be focused on those two, and I might even get into collisions if I can figure it out/have time between classes.
